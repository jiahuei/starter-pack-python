# When `text` is set to "auto", the path is marked for automatic end-of-line conversion.
# If Git decides that the content is text, its line endings are converted to LF on checkin.
# When the file has been committed with CRLF, no conversion is done.

* text=auto eol=lf

# These files are text and should be normalized (Convert crlf => lf)
# Setting the `text` attribute on a path enables end-of-line normalization and marks the path as a text file.
# End-of-line conversion takes place without guessing the content type.
